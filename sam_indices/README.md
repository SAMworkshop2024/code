# Various ways to compute the SAM

This folder can be used to dump different scripts and ways to compute the SAM. These can be in any language of your choice (except French, nobody codes in French!). 

It would be good to have a working example script to know how the whole thing works. Eventually, we will want to bring these definitions together, compare, and decide which to use for the paper.
