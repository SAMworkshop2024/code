# Code for "Southern Annular Mode dynamics, projections and impacts in a changing climate" by Purich et al.

This code repository allows for re-creation of figures from Purich et al., "Southern Annular Mode dynamics, projections and impacts in a changing climate".

Most script require data files stored separately at ... Download all data in that directory.

In general, required python packages are `xarray`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `cartopy`, `scipy`.

To reproduce the figures, follow below steps:

## All figures

Set variable `data_path` in each script to the path of the data files downloaded above.

## Figure 1

The script for this figure is `Fig1.ipynb`.

Run all cells. Resulting figure will be `Fig1.pdf`.

## Figure 2

The main script for this figure is `Fig2.py`. 

run ``python Fig2.py`` and resulting figure will be `Fig2.pdf`.

Requires `aostools` available [in this directory](https://github.com/SAMworkshop2024/aostools) or [this repository](https://github.com/mjucker/aostools).

## Figure 3


## Figure 4

The script for this figure is `Fig4.ipynb`.

Run  all cells. Resulting figure will be `Fig4.pdf`.


## Figure 5

The script for this figure is `Fig5.ipynb`.

Run all cells. Resulting figures will be `Fig5ac.pdf` and `Fig5bd.pdf`.
